# Neverending-Challenge-Python
A simple brute forcing challenge made with python.

This pythin script will create a folder called Neverending Challenge in your chosen directory.  In this folder, there are many nested folders, all with files called Read This.txt. The files will all have messages at the end. You need to find the one with the unique message. Good luck!

Setup: Run the python script in python 3+ and input your directory.

Rules:
-You may not modify the code, but you may read it. Adding print statements etc. is obviously unfair. If you manage to crack my 100% homemade obfuscation, good job!\
-Brute forcing or using external programs is allowed, but you may not debug this program itself.
